#### Low degree points on algebraic varieties
I'm interested in low degree points on algebraic varieties over number fields. 

The situation for curves is the best understood so far. Let $$C/k$$ be a nice curve of genus $$g$$ over a number field $$k$$ and denote $$C^{(d)}$$ the $d$th symmetric power of $$C$$, that is 

$$C^{(d)}(k) = \{ d\text{-tuples of points } x \in C(k^s) \text{ fixed by Gal}(k^s/k) \}.$$

This variety parametrizes low degree points on $$C$$, and gives the $$k$$-divisors of degree $$d$$. Now take an Abel Jacobi map mapping these divisors to their classes in the Jacobian $$J(C)$$, $$\alpha: C^{(d)} \to J(C)$$ and we see that a fiber of $$\alpha$$ is a linear system of divisors being collapsed down to their class in the Picard group. Faltings' Other Theorem / Mordell-Lang tells us that $$W_d(k) = \alpha(C^{(d)})(k)$$ is contained in a finite union of abelian subvariety translates in $$J(C)$$, so infinite collections of degree $$d$$ points on $$C$$ correspond either to a fiber of $$\alpha$$ or the rational points of an abelian subvariety of the Jacobian. Points not coming from such a infinite collection are said to be isolated. So for example, rational points on curves of genus $$g \geq 2$$ are isolated.

For example, we can take $$C$$ is a genus 2 bielliptic curve (so admits degree 2 maps to $$P^1$$ and $$E$$ for some elliptic curve $$E$$). Say of the form $$C: y^2 = x^6 - Ax^2 - B$$ , $$E: s^2 = t^3 - Ax - B$$, we can get infinite collections of degree 2 points on $$C$$ by pullbacks of rational points on $$\mathbb{P}^1$$, so of the form $$ (x, \pm \sqrt{x^6 - Ax^2 - B})$$ or if $$E$$ has positive rank, the pullbacks here yield points of the form $$ (\pm \sqrt{t}, s)$$. 

There are examples where these points can come from an elliptic curve in the Jacobian but *not from a map* from $$C$$ to an elliptic curve. In genus 7 [Debarre and Fahlaoui](http://www.numdam.org/item/CM_1993__88_3_235_0/) constructed a nice curve $$C \subseteq E^{(2)}$$ for $$E$$ an elliptic curve with infinitely many degree $$4$$ points, yet no geometric degree 4 map to an elliptic curve or $$\mathbb{P}^1$$. For degrees $$d \leq 5$$, their construction is known to be the only way to get infinitely many points not coming from such a map (see [Kadets and Vogt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01067)).

If you want to learn more, I highly reccomend this survey article by [Viray and Vogt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14353).

Questions I'm thinking about:

- Can we better understand the collections of points coming from a rational map? (Thin Sets)
- Given a surface $$X$$, what is the minimum degree such that the points of degree $$d$$ are Zariski dense?
- Can we construct more examples of low degree, yet not rational, isolated points?
- Can we say something nontrivial about low degree points on higher dimensional varieties using different measures of irrationality?

If you have answers or want to chat about any of this stuff, feel free to email me!
