# Directed Reading Program

I am a mentor for Dartmouth's Directed Reading Program. I encourage all Dartmouth undergraduates to take a look at the interesting projects listed on the main site. That means you reading this. Regardless of your previous math exposure, I firmly believe everyone should have rewarding mathematical experiences, so if you'd like to see some mathematical beauty in the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory, category theory or computation, please get in touch. If you are not an undergraduate at Dartmouth but are still interested in a project listed below, I may still be able to offer a directed reading over zoom depending on my availability.

## Offered Projects

### Algebraic Geometry in Coding Theory and Cryptography

Book: Algebraic Geometry in Coding Theory and Cryptography Harald Niederreiter and Chaoping Xing

Prerequisites: Math 25 or 31 or 71 or 75 or (CS 55 and CS 30) or Equivalent

Notes: This project would be ideal for either a math student interested in algebra, geometry, and number theory, or for a computer science student interested in how mathematical structure is used to get data from one computer to another securely. I want to read this book with you because it uses releatively few prerequisites to do some very cool things like proving the Hasse-Weil inequality. Specific topics will be tailored to student interests.

### Arithmetic Geometry

Book: Introduction to Arithmetic Geometry (Notes) by Bjorn Poonen

Prerequisites: Math 71 or Math 31 or Equivalent

Notes: Arithmetic geometry studies the solutions to polynomial equations over the rational numbers and finite fields. To do this, we can change our perspective on polynomial equations by considering solutions over many different fields. Over the complex numbers, x^3 - 1 has three solutions, but over the real numbers we can see with calculus that there is only one solution. Although f = x^2 - 2 has two real solutions, f has no rational solutions, and over finite fields with q = p^r elements, p prime, using quadratic reciprocity one can prove f has a solution if and only if p is congruent to plus or minus 1 mod 8 or n is even. In this project, we'll be studying equations in two or more variables with a focus on quadratics and cubics.

### Elliptic Curves

Potential Books: Rational Points on Elliptic Curves by Silverman and Tate, Elliptic Curves: Number Theory and Cryptography by Washington

Prerequisites: Math 71 or Math 31 or Equivalent

Notes: Elliptic curves are beautiful geometric objects with a very intrecate symmetry structure. We'll learn the basics of algebraic curves before diving into proving there is a group law on elliptic curves. Further topics will depend on the interests of the student and could take on a more number theoretic or cryptographic direction based on the interests of the student.

### Category Theory for Programmers

Book: Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski

Prerequisites: Some Coding Experience

In this project, we'll learn the basics of category theory and functional programming. We'll write code in Scala or Haskell, but no previous knowledge of these languages is assumed.

### Commutative Algebra

Book: Introduction To Commutative Algebra by Atiyah and MacDonald

Prerequisites: Math 71 or Equivalent

Notes: This project is aimed at those interested in going to graduate school in mathematics with an interest in algebraic number theory or algebraic geometry. Commutative algebra is a beautiful subject in its own right, and is fundemental to both subjects as a grammar for proving hard theorems. This project will be difficult: the listed book is fantastic in that it develops the subject through exercises.
