# Luke Askew
I'm a third year Mathematics PhD Candidate at Dartmouth College.

I study arithmetic geometry advised by [Asher Auel](https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~auel/).

If you are a Dartmouth undergrad interested in a project from the Directed Reading Program, please see the [projects page](/drp).

- [Federico Ardila's Axioms](https://fardila.com/): 

Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be David Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra with a view towards Algebraic Geometry. I am an attempt to write on commutative algebra in a way that includes the geometric ideas that played a great role in its formation; with a view, in short, towards Algebraic Geometry. I cover the material that graduate students studying Algebraic Geometry - and in particular those  studying the book Algebraic Geometry by Robin Hartshorne - should know.  The reader should have had one year of basic graduate algebra. Which Springer GTM would *you* be?
