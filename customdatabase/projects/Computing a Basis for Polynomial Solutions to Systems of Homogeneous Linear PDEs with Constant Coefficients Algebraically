Computing a Basis for Polynomial Solutions to Systems of Homogeneous Linear PDEs with Constant Coefficients Algebraically
This final poster project was completed in my first semester as a student at CSU and was a winner for a cash prize for abstract algebra at CSU's undergraduate math poster competition. I was concurrently taking my first course in differential equations so when I found a book called Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations by Sturmfels which had an algorithm relating the two courses it became the basis for the poster. I found that allowing differential operators as generators of an ideal to be a notably interesting trick to combine tools from algebra and calculus and implemented a version of the algorithm in sage.
