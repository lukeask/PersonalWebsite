Riemann's Zeta Function and Applications to Number Theory
In this final course project for my undergraduate number theory course, I incorporated some math from my first graduate course in complex analysis taken concurrently to start my first exposure to analytic number theory. I particularly enjoyed learning about Abelâ€™s partial summation formula since it provides an interesting link between a discrete sum and an integral which can be exploited to make powerful statements about prime numbers.
