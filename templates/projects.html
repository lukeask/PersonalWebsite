  <h3>Persistent Homology-Based Approaches to Localization</h3>
    <p>Final REU Project at Montana State University, accepted to the 2020 National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) poster session but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>In situations where GPS is unavailable, denied, or inaccurate, identifying local position in a global space is still desired.  Our project evaluates tools from topological data analysis for use in identifying global location using only local terrain information which could be collected with portable devices. A topology driven approach to localization could allow for easier underground navigation, and refinement of mapping software both in cities and in remote areas. Using LiDAR scans of the topography of Yellowstone National Park, we created a database of local locations in the park. For each location, we computed upper star, lower star, and Vietoris-Rips filtrations before computing a persistence diagram for each filtration. With our method, we can then search for a location by computing a persistence diagram and comparing its bottleneck distance to each persistence diagram in our database; those diagrams with the lowest bottleneck distance to the location we searched for are then returned. Our project verified that this method identifies an exact copy of local data in the database for each filtration. We then compared filtrations by testing weather the method correctly identified a location with a copy to which Gaussian error is applied. We found that the Vietoris-Rips filtrations outperformed lower and upper star filtrations in this test. Finally, we compared filtrations with local data spanning multiple database entries, finding that significant overlap of data is required for correct identification with all filtrations. Future work applying our methods to urban, deforested, or environments with otherwise different terrain features will create a more wholistic picture of the methodâ€™s efficacy. </p>
