    I am a {{yearstring}} graduate student at Dartmouth College.
    </p>


    <p>
    Previously, I recieved my B.S. in Mathematics at Colorado State University in 2022 and my A.S. in Mathematics from Front Range Community College in 2019.
    </p>


    <p>
    My curent interests lie in arithmetic geometry. I am particularly interested in results for finding rational points on varieties.
