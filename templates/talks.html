<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The skeleton of a category categorifies the notion of selecting a representative up to equivalence. Assuming no prior knowledge of categories, we will introduce the basics of category theory, see how skeletons can give a better definition for the fundamental group of a topological space, and have fun with groupoids.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Proposed in 1900 during Hilbert’s famous address to the ICM and proven impossible to solve by Matiyasevich in 1970, the problem of deciding whether a Diophantine equation has an integral solution has motivated current research to find rational points on varieties. We will survey the resolution of the original problem before discussing algorithms which determine if a Diophantine equation has a solution in several fields with emphasis on the interplay of solutions over Q_p and Q.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>After a brief review of of Cartesian closed categories and first order logic, we introduce topoi, a generalization of Cartesian closed categories, building to an example of a boolean topos satisfying the categorical axiom of choice in which the continuum hypothesis fails. </p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Topoi, a friendly categorification of topology, are ubiquitous in modern mathematics, being utilized everywhere from geometry, to topology, to logic. In this talk, we will introduce topoi through two themes that historically motivated their development: limits and presheaves. With a few definitions from category theory, we define elementary and Grothendieck topoi, drawing on familiar examples from geometry throughout.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>In situations where GPS is unavailable, denied, or inaccurate, identifying local position in a global space is still desired.  Our project evaluates tools from topological data analysis for use in identifying global location using only local terrain information which could be collected with portable devices. A topology driven approach to localization could allow for easier underground navigation, and refinement of mapping software both in cities and in remote areas. Using LiDAR scans of the topography of Yellowstone National Park, we created a database of local locations in the park. For each location, we computed upper star, lower star, and Vietoris-Rips filtrations before computing a persistence diagram for each filtration. With our method, we can then search for a location by computing a persistence diagram and comparing its bottleneck distance to each persistence diagram in our database; those diagrams with the lowest bottleneck distance to the location we searched for are then returned. Our project verified that this method identifies an exact copy of local data in the database for each filtration. We then compared filtrations by testing weather the method correctly identified a location with a copy to which Gaussian error is applied. We found that the Vietoris-Rips filtrations outperformed lower and upper star filtrations in this test. Finally, we compared filtrations with local data spanning multiple database entries, finding that significant overlap of data is required for correct identification with all filtrations. Future work applying our methods to urban, deforested, or environments with otherwise different terrain features will create a more holistic picture of the method’s efficacy. </p>
